Cancellation Efficiency: Out of 15 total orders, 2 were canceled, but only 1 cancellation exceeded the 60-minute policy, resulting in a 6.67% SLA violation rate. Automating cancellation workflows can improve customer experience and reduce delays.

User Intent Patterns: Most user messages (72.44%) are related to product search with a 17% purchase conversion. Higher purchase rates (around 19–20%) come from product comparison and FAQ intents. Promoting comparison tools and FAQs early can increase sales.

Conversion Funnel by Device: Mobile users show stronger engagement early with 79.25% moving from loaded to interact, compared to 67.35% on desktop. However, final purchase rates are similar (~35–38%). Simplifying mobile checkout, like adding one-tap payment options, can boost conversions.

Next Steps:

Automate and improve cancellation process to meet SLA.

Enhance product comparison and FAQ visibility to increase purchase likelihood.

Optimize mobile checkout flow and payment options to reduce drop-offs.
